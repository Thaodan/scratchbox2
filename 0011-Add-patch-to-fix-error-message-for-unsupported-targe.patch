Subject: [PATCH] Add patch to fix error message for unsupported target

This error message now instructs to edit the correct file
to add support for new target.

The patch has been submited upstream as well, so hopefully it won't be
needed anymore upon the new version release.

Original patch by: Oleg Girko <ol+mer@infoserver.ru>
