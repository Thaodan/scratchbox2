Notes about Scratchbox2, development versions 2.3.x:
====================================================
Author: Lauri T. Aarnio

Disclaimer:
	All versions in the 2.3.x are development snapshots.
	There are new features, but everything may not work as expected.
	The next stable version will be 2.4.

Overview:
---------
2.3 has currently following focus areas, which can be considered either
new features or improvements of old ones:

1) Union directory support: Two or more directories can be bound together,
   so that opendir() will see all entries from all component directories.

2) A networking subsystem. It is bit like a firewall - adds rules
   for controlling IP address operations: What addresses can be connected to,
   and what addresses the listeners can use.

3) Path mapping logic has been re-implemented in C (originally, it was
   written in Lua).

4) Exec logic (partially) in C

5) Fakeroot has been replaced with an internal, more comprehensive
   solution (see "VIRTUAL PERMISSIONS" in the manual page.)

In addition to these, there are smaller improvements here and there.
For example, rule files have been reorganized, and there are some changes
in them that had to be made because of other changes.

Bug reporting: Please send bug reports, improvement ideas (or even
better, patches) to <scratchbox-devel@lists.scratchbox.org>


More detailed description about the main areas follows:

1. Union directories
--------------------

The algorithm: Union directories are simulated by creating temporary
directories, which contain names from all component directories.
opendir() is redirected to open that kind of temp.directory, and the
result is that readdir() etc will then return all names just as expected.
This is done for directories that are listed in the rule file, not for
every directory.

Status: The implementation works, but could be improved. 
First weakness is that the temporary directory is populated every time
when opendir() is called, even if it exists already. The second thing
is that if files are removed from the component directories, the names
won't be removed from the temp.directory. Together these two mean that
union directories are fully usable only with read only targets, and even
there they should not be used for performance-critical location
(ideally, it would be great if union directories could be used for
most directories in the development-oriented modes, "accel" and "simple").
But this feature solved some nasty problems with some tools (pkg-config,
at least)

The rule syntax is currently too simple: It requires full, real paths
to the component directories. Supporting at least prefix mapping in the
rules would make this a lot more generic feature.

2. Networking subsystem
-----------------------

The networking subsystem is bit like a firewall - adds rules for
controlling IP address operations: What addresses can be connected to,
and what addresses the listeners can use. Same kind of rules that are used
to virtualize your filesystem namespace, but now applied to a slightly
different domain.

Unlike typical firewalls, that have most focus on protecting you from
unwanted incoming traffic, the primary motivation for this was to control
outgoing connections. 
We have seen that there are really strange, unexpected outgoing connections
from various places, even while building some OSS packages.

So, now it is possible to execute the builds like

$ sb2 -n offline dpkg-buildpackage

...and the network appears to be offline for all processes that run inside
the SB2 session (but see "limitations" below).

Or, you can test your software with

$ sb2 -e -n localhost ./yourprogram

...and "yourprogram" will observe that it will be able to connect to
local addresses only.

Another useful feature is logging: Set level to "net", and SB2 logs
network-related events. Together with the "nomap" filesystem mapping mode,
you can also test what ordinary programs (programs that belong to the
host OS) are doing. For example:

$ sb2 -m nomap -n localhost -L net nc www.nokia.com 80

...and you should see some denied connection attempts to port
53 (dns), at least.

Standard networking modes include "online" (which is the default, unless
the new "-n" option is used), "offline", "localhost" and "online_privatenets". 
I hope that the names are descriptive enough.. These networking modes can be
freely mixed with the filesystem mapping modes ("emulate", "simple", etc).

It should be quite straightforward to add more rulesets, if needed.
For example, the "online_privatenets" mode uses rules like

	{address = "10.0.0.0/8", allow = true},

and these should be easy to extend by anyone who have written any firewalling
rules, I think.

How it works internally:

SB2 attaches to connect(), bind(), sendto() and sendmsg() functions and
examines socket address structures whenever needed. It isn't a real firewall,
which would process each IP packet separately.

Other limitations, missing things and bugs:

The implementation is somewhat connection-oriented. For example, receiving
UDP packets with recvfrom() is still possible regardless of networking mode.

Another limitation (or a feature that would be useful, but doesn't exist) is
that it doesn't process names, i.e. gethostbyname(), getaddrinfo(), etc could
be handled by SB2, and then it could make decisions based on names - a somewhat
higher level than what is possible with raw IP addresses. But that haven't
been implemented.


3. Path mapping logic in C
--------------------------

General: The path mapping subsystem consists of two main parts: Path resolution
logic replaces OS's path resolution (SB2 can't rely on OS's path resolution
due to mapping of symbolic links). It is quite strictly defined (see "man
path_resolution"). And implemented in C.

The other part, path mapping logic, was implemented in Lua in the early
days of SB2 development. However, having the Lua interpreter running in
every process is not really an optimal solution (there are several reasons
for this, including performance).
So, it was decided to create another implementation of path mapping logic
in C. This would not solve all Lua-related problems instantly; the other
two Lua-based subsystems (exec and networking) still mean that the Lua
interpreter is needed, but it isn't necessarily initialized every time
anymore [hopefully someday those could be re-implemented in C, too]

Current status: The new path mapping logic is available for testing.
Versions 2.3.5- have two mapping engines: The old one (in Lua)
and the new one (in C). 

Starting from 2.3.42 the C mapping engine is the default. The old
code can still be enabled by an environment variable:

- setenv SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD="Lua"
  All paths are mapped with the Lua engine only.

- setenv SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD="C"
  All paths are mapped with the C engine only.

- setenv SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD="C2"
  All paths are mapped with the C engine, but if path mapping
  fails, Lua mapping is tried. Note that there are some cases
  (especially in path reversing side) where pathmapping simply
  produces no result.

- setenv SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD="Both"
  Use both engines and log differences. Same as the default.

The algorithms: The old implementation (in Lua) is considered stable,
and produces correct results (AFAIK). Therefore, the C engine replicates
same algorithms, even if they are not the most powerful algorithms 
on this planet. Replacing e.g. the string lookup algorithms would be
a different story.
There is one big difference in these two implementations: The old
thing loads all rules when a process is started inside a session,
while the new implementation loads rules  only once when session 
is created. Some changes had to be done to the rule files (and syntax)
because of this.

N.B. Script interpreter mapping (defined in the exec policy files)
still use the Lua mapping engine, always.

The rule database, "ruletree":
The C-based implementation collects rules to a binary, memory mapped
database when a session is created (rules are still expressed as
Lua data structures). This "ruletree" structure can also be used to 
store other rules (exec rules, networking rules) in the future.
Note that the binary structures are position independent; no pointers,
just offsets there. And the ruletree shall not be modified after it has
been created (no locks, etc)

Testing and debugging:
0) setenv SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD="Both"
1) To verify the results, use SB2 as usual. If there are
different results from Lua and C mappings, those will be logged
as errors. 
2) activate debug messages (-d) and check if there are cases that
the C engine can't map at all; grep for "ResultCheck" from the
debug log.
3) Run your processes with SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD=C and check that
the results are the same as without it.
4) the ruletree can be dumped with utils/sb2-ruletree. 

Still missing / not implemented:
1. There are still many "FIXME" comments in the source. Check and fix..
2. No code reviews have been done. there might be memory leaks, etc.
3. Free-format "func_name" conditions are not supported, and won't be
   supported. Instead, a new condition has replaced those (reason: "func_name"
   is a Lua regexp. It's insane to try to support those in the future.
   The replacement mechanism, "func_class", is a simple bitmask)
4. Probably there are also other, undocumented restrictions :-)

4. Exec logic (partially) in C
------------------------------
All versions up to 2.3.23 used a combination of C and Lua code
for converting parameters of the exec calls (execvp(), etc).
The algorithm is described in sb_exec.c.

Version 2.3.24 re-implemented parts of the exec preprocessing 
logic partially in C; Version 2.3.25 does it completely in C.
Exec preprocessing rules (the "argvmods" table) is now in "ruletree".
There are no alternatives, preprocessing is now always done with
the new implementation.

Version 2.3.28 got another reimplementation; exec policy selection
is now written in C.

Other parts of the exec logic (postprocessing parameters for
native and foreign binaries etc) still use in Lua code.


5. The Virtual Permission subsystem, which superseded "fakeroot"
----------------------------------------------------------------
Versions up to 2.3.29 used "fakeroot" for simulating superuser
privileges. However, that tool turned out to be somewhat too fake,
and having two different LD_PRELOAD libraries was a nightmare
to maintain, too. So, version 2.3.41 introduced a complete 
replacement for that. It is true replacement; it does not share
any code with the "fakeroot" utility.

See the manual page for more details.
